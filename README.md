The main goal of this full-stack project was to follow through with my mvp features, which include:

- Discussions - post discussions about topic that other users have the ability to give input
- Shopping Cart - input products into cart with real time price updating for user to checkout
- Reviews - be able to leave reviews on a certain product for users to decided if its a good purchase
- Replies - be able to reply to users dicussions and other users can reply to the users reply

In addition to the mvp features I was able to implement some of my bonus features:
